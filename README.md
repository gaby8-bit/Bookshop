# POO
Creation of an application called "Bookshop" using OOP principles.
The app is made after how it comes:at the moment of starting it the user is creating an account and in this account he has the possibility to borrow/buy books from a library.In case he forgets the account password there is the possibility to reset it.He also has the possibility to signal bugs.
In ,,carti.txt" file the librarian introduces the books available in the library inventory.
In ,,date.txt" file we are going to save the credentials for every app user.
In ,,log.txt" file we are going to show every wrong step that the user is making.
After the user buys/borrows a book we are going to create a file intituled ,,lastname+firstname" in which we are going to save that books.
And in ,,sesizari.txt" file we are going to save the reported by the user bugs.
